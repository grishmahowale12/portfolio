    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Ever since I started learning technology, I’ve been fascinated by how digital systems can solve real-world problems. I enjoy breaking down complex challenges into manageable solutions and creating projects that are both functional and user-friendly.</p>

    <p>Along the way, I’ve gained experience with some key technologies:</p>

    <div class="skills-icons"> <span>💻 HTML/CSS</span> <span>🐍 Python</span> <span>🔒 Cybersecurity</span> <span>🗂️ Web Dev</span> </div>

    <p>These skills allow me to build projects that are both functional and secure, while also exploring new ideas in tech creatively.</p>

    <p>Apart from coding, I have a creative side that I express through dancing and video content creation. Working on these projects has taught me discipline, collaboration, and attention to detail skills I bring into my tech work as well.</p>

    <p>Community engagement is also important to me. I like volunteering to help organizations improve their digital presence and outreach. These experiences have helped me develop problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills that complement my technical knowledge.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, I strive to combine creativity, technical expertise, and curiosity to build innovative solutions while making a positive impact through technology.</p>
